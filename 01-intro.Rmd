# Introduction {#intro}

This book is a collection of ideas, notes, exercises and code that students of the MSc in Data Science at Barcelona GSE were exposed and/or came up with during their studies. 

## R package

The book uses a complementary R package [fromScratchR](https://github.com/pat-alt/fromScratchR) which collects the R code used throughout the book. The book can be read without using the package, but in case you want to play with the code you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pat-alt/fromScratchR")
```
