["vc.html", "Chapter 7 VC theory 7.1 VC dimension", " Chapter 7 VC theory In Chapter 6 we defined the shatter coefficient as the number of times we can intersect \\(\\{X_1,...,X_n\\}\\in\\mathcal{X}\\) with subsets \\(A\\) of \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) that belong to the family \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), in particular: \\[ \\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} &amp;&amp; S(X_1^n,\\mathcal{A})&amp;= \\left|\\{A\\cup\\{X_1,...,X_n\\}:A\\in\\mathcal{A}\\} \\right| \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation} \\] We further defined: \\[ \\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} &amp;&amp; S_{\\mathcal{A}}(n)&amp;=\\max_{X_1,...,X_n}S(X_1^n,\\mathcal{A}) \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation} \\] Clearly, we have that \\(S(X_1^n,\\mathcal{A})\\le2^n\\), where \\(2^n\\) is simply the total number of subsets of \\(n\\) points: each point can either be in a given subset or not. Definition 7.1 If \\(S(X_1^n,\\mathcal{A})=2^n\\), then we say that the class \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) shatters \\(\\{X_1,...,X_n\\}\\). Suppose the class \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) shatter the \\(n\\) points. This means that for each possible subset, we can find a set in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) that can be intersected with the subset. In the context of our initial problem \\(\\mathbb{E} \\max_{A\\in\\mathcal{A}} |P_n(A)-P(A)|\\) and the VC theorem, this means we are in trouble: we expect that overfitting will occur. 7.1 VC dimension Definition 7.2 Let \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) be a class if sets. The the VC dimension of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is the largest integer such that \\(S_{\\mathcal{A}}(V)=2^V\\). In other words, \\(V\\) is the size of the largest set of points that can be shattered by \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). If \\(S_{\\mathcal{A}}(n)=2^n\\) for all \\(n\\), then \\(V=\\infty\\) "]
