The goal of this book is to collect in a structured manner any ideas, notes, exercises and code that I come across as a student of data science. Focus will always be on showing how concepts can be implemented from scratch, avoiding the usage of packages as much as possible. The rationale for this is that from my own experience, trying to implement algorithms from scratch is often easier than one would think and very rewarding and educational. For a current version of the book see [here](https://pat-alt.github.io/fromScratch/). This is a work-in-progress in its very early stages, so any comments, ideas, thoughts are welcome. 

## R package

The book uses a complementary R package [fromScratchR](https://github.com/pat-alt/fromScratchR) which collects the R code used throughout the book. The book can be read without using the package, but in case you want to play with the code you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pat-alt/fromScratchR")
```
