# Content

The goal of this book is to collect in a structured manner any ideas, notes, exercises and code that I come across as a student of data science. Focus will always be on showing how concepts can be implemented from scratch, avoiding the usage of packages as much as possible. The rationale for this is that from my own experience, trying to implement algorithms from scratch is often easier than one would think and very rewarding and educational. This is a work-in-progress in its very early stages, so any comments, ideas, thoughts are welcome.
