# Content

This book is a collection of ideas, notes, exercises and code covering a broad range of topics in Data Science. It is written by students for students. The structure is inherently somewhat loose and this is very much a work in progress. Feedback and comments are therefore more than welcome, although time and resources to act on them is scarce.
